# 12.5-iDK
Developed a comprehensive 3D model and technical drawings or a 12.5" iDK telescope.

The goal of this project is to create my own telescope using telescopes currently on the market as inspiration. This project started with purchasing a 12.5" iDK telescope, and recreating it in Solidworks. From there, creating technical drawings, sourcing fabrication, developing an accurate and organized bill of materials, and building my own prototype to test. Currently personalizing/customizing the design. Examples of pictures and drawings can be found in other files.
